# EX 41 C program to write a function to find the peek of stack using array.
## AIM:
To write a function to find the peek of stack using array.

## Algorithm
1. Check if the stack is empty (i.e., top == -1):
   - If yes, print "Stack is empty" or handle underflow.
   - Exit the function.

2. Else:
   - Access the element at the 'top' index of the array.
   - Print that element as the top of the stack (peek value).
  

## Program:
